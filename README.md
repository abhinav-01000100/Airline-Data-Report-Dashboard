# Airline-Data-Report-Dashboard
A detailed analysis of the airline performance and delay reports in USA between the years 2005 and 2020 expressed with interactive dashboards created with python.
It a first attempt project at displaying my skills required to take a step further into the field of data science.
The dashboards are clear to understand and highly interactive making them easy to understand and view different data individually if required.
